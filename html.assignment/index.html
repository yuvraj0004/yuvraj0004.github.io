     I had done my 12<sup>th</sup> from my  <abbr title="st joseph convent school">stjs</abbr> and I had huge interest in physical activities such as playing basketball,cricket and volleyball. I also had great interest in learning singing skills and love to listen music and my favourite singer is Sidhu Moosewala and also loves to learn new different foreign languages as it is very important to learn to have good communication skills.
